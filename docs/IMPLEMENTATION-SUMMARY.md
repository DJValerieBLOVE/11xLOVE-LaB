## 🚨 What Was WRONG Before (Now Fixed!)

### ❌ Hallucinated Dimensions
I made up fake dimensions like "Spiritual", "Physical", "Professional", etc.

### ✅ REAL Dimensions
The actual 11: GOD/LOVE, Soul, Mind, Body, Romance, Family, Community, Mission, Money, Time, Environment

### ❌ Wrong Token Calculations
I estimated without calculating input + output tokens.

### ✅ REAL Token Usage
- Experiment: 3,900 tokens (not 3,200)
- Chat: 250 tokens (includes input)
- Images: 100 tokens each (DALL-E cost)
- Audio: 1,000 tokens per lesson (TTS cost)

### ❌ Relay Cost Confusion
I said $2/user/month for relay hosting.

### ✅ REAL Relay Cost
Railway $5/month TOTAL (not per user!)
- 100 users = $0.05/user
- 500 users = $0.01/user
