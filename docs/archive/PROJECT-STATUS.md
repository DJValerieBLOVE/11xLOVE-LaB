## 🎯 Current Decisions

### **Privacy Architecture (FINAL):**
- 🔴 Tribe messages → NEVER shareable
- 🟡 Big Dreams/Journals → Private by default, optional share with warning
- 🟢 Completions/Feed → Shareable to public Nostr

### **AI Provider (FINAL):**
- **OpenRouter** with **Grok 4.1 Fast** (xAI)
- Cost: $0.37 per 1M tokens
- Prompt caching: 90%+ savings

### **Pricing (FINAL):**
- **Free**: Browse only, no AI
- **Member**: $11/month → 2M tokens
- **BYOK**: $11/month → Unlimited (user's key)
- **Creator**: $25/month → 10M tokens

## 🔑 Key Files for AI Agents

When starting a new session, read these files:

1. **PLAN.md** - Full build spec and chunk status
2. **SESSION_NOTES.md** - Current session progress
3. **docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md** (this file) - Overview
4. **docs/AI-ARCHITECTURE.md** - OpenRouter integration
5. **docs/11x-LOVE-CODE-CURRICULUM.md** - Lesson content

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

**For Next AI Agent:**

1. Read SESSION_NOTES.md for latest context
2. **Deploy and test** — verify text is black, feed is fresh on live site
3. Implement Chunk 9: Completion Receipts
4. Implement Chunk 10: Streak Tracking
5. Start Chunk 12: Magic Mentor AI

**Key Requirements:**
- Use existing hooks (useLabPublish, useLabOnlyPublish)
- All data stored on Railway relay
- Encrypted with NIP-44 where needed
- Follow existing patterns in codebase

**Important CSS Notes:**
- Use `text-black` for critical text, NOT `text-foreground` (Tailwind CDN overrides CSS variables)
- Use `text-gray-500` for metadata, NOT `text-muted-foreground`
- Do NOT remove the plain `<style>` tag in index.html — it prevents the CDN from gray-ifying text
- See CRITICAL_BUGS.md for full architecture notes
