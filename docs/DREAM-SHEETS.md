# Dream Book Journal — All Worksheets (Dream Sheets)

**Complete collection of all Dream Sheet prompts for the 11x LOVE Code Masterclass**

This journal walks alongside students through every lesson. Each entry matches a lesson, providing space for the real inner work: pen-to-paper, hand-on-heart transformation.

## HOW TO USE THE DREAM BOOK

- **One entry per lesson** — Don't skip ahead. Trust the process.

- **No judgment** — There are no wrong answers. Only honest ones.
- **Find an accountability buddy** — Share wins, struggles, breakthroughs. Transformation is a team sport.

## CLOSING BLESSING

Aloha, Beautiful Soul.

If you're holding this journal and you've made it here — whether you filled in every blank or just a few — I am so damn proud of you.

You showed up. You did the work. You looked at the truth with courage and LOVE. You named your villains. You buried what no longer serves you. You designed your Divine Masterpiece. And you wrote your CODE.

That takes guts. That takes BRAVERY. That takes a Superhero.

And that's exactly what you are.

This is your CODE. This is your LIFE. You are your Divine Masterpiece.

Now go live it. One day at a time. One SNAP! at a time. One Victory In Progress at a time.

And remember — you don't have to do it alone. Find your buddy. Join the LaB. Show up daily. Celebrate EVERYTHING.

**You are LOVE and You are LOVED.**

Peace, LOVE, & Warm Aloha 🩷

— DJ Valerie B LOVE
